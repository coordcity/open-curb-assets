# Open Curb Assets Specification

The [Open Curb Assets Data specification](https://github.com/coordcity/open-curb-assets/blob/master/open-curb-assets-spec.md) defines a format for sharing data about
features of curbs. This includes both features of the sidewalk, like bike racks,
parking signs, and fire hydrants, as well as features of the street, like lane
markings, curb cuts, and crosswalks. What these features all have in common is
that they serve to define which activities can happen along the side of a street.
